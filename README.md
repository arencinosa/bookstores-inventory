# README

This project is intented to be "...an inventory system that can support multiple bookstores":

> This system should support identifying when one or more books are out of stock in a specific store. Also note that two stores can have the same book, however, their stock levels should be independent.


> Rules:
>
>    [...] use any SQL-type database (ex. Postgres, MySql, Sqlite, etc.)
>    Use Rails
>    Provide access to the code (ex. Github)
>    Provide some seed data for testing



> Requirements:
>
>    API endpoints to:
>   - Fetch, create, and update stock levels
>   - Delete books
>
>    Simple front-end interface to display the current inventory level of books for each store
